## About the Project:

This project gets the ranking data for Street Fighter 6 from the [Street Fighter 6 rankings website](https://www.streetfighter.com/6/buckler/ranking/league) to a file CSV containing the following information for use in data analysis:
- Player ID (CFN name)
- Platform (Steam / Crossplay)
- Character 
- League Points
- League Rank (Rookie through Master)
- Master Rating (Ratingfor Master Only)
- Home Name (Country listed on Profile)

## Files: 
- `get_sf6_ranks.py` loops through each rank and retrieves number of results as specified in the file. Output to csv
- `csv_join.py` combines csv's generated by `get_sf6_ranks.py`
- `masters_data.py` attempts to get **main** character for each player by sorting by rating and dropping duplicates (keeps highest rated character) and drops 1500 rated accounts (some may be active but many get Masters rank @1500 rating and do not play rank again)

## Data Analysis Usage:

The scripts above were used to gather a representative data set for each rank by returning the top 10,000 player / character combos in each rank (Rookie 1 through Masters). The total dataset contained 356,028 rows. The only division of the 36 not to have 10,000 players is Diamond 5. The assumption here is that if the player is good enough to achieve Diamond 5 they are good enough to get to Masters with enough playing. 

Some general observations from this dataset:

- US and Japan have a similar number of distinct players: 66,224 vs 65,157 respectively. **note** *this is only as accurate as the assumption players put their actual country*
- JP has the highest average league points followed by A.K.I and Rashid. It can be inferred that JP is a strong character that tends towards players that are more skilled. A.K.I. and Rashid are paid DLC characters and the assumption here is that those who pay for DLC are more likely to be regular players and thus have a higher than average skill level.

## Moving Forward

Plans to periodicaly get Masters rank data to add to the dataset. This will hopefully reduce the number of *'dead' accounts* which are calibrated at 1500 Rating and not touched again as there will be more data points for each Players rating. Only those with several weeks worth of 1500 rating will be removed. This will involve adding a date to the data to categorise it and likely shift the storage of the dataset from a csv to a locally hosted postgreSQL databse.
